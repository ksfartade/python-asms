        "### Python OOPs Questions\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "- It is a style of writing code which consists of classes as a blueprint and object of those classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "- Class is the blueprint for creating an object which consist of methods and variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "- object is the running instance of class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation ?\n",
        "- Abstraction is used for hiding the sensitive information form user and it is implemented using the abstract classes and methods. Encapsulation is the bundling of methods and variables into single class and controll their accesses with different access modifiers.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  What are dunder methods in Python ?\n",
        "- It is a special type of methods called by python only at special operations, like add, substract, printing.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP ?\n",
        "- It is used to get all the properties and methdos from the parent class into the child class without writing the complete code again.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "- It is a multiple form of the single entity. We can implement polymorphism in python using method overloading and overriding techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  How is encapsulation achieved in Python ?\n",
        "- Using class with different access modifires we can acheive encapsulation. Define getter and setters for the sensitive variables updation.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python ?\n",
        "- It is a special method in python classes which is used to initiase the class object.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python ?\n",
        "- class methods has the access to the class variables and has class object as first argument. Static methods don't have access to any class or object data.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python ?\n",
        "- It is defination of same method name with different purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP ?\n",
        "- It is style of redefining the method from parent class in child class. It is used in classes inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python ?\n",
        "- It is a decorator used to make the class method as a class property and access that method as a class property.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP ?\n",
        "- We can use single method in multiple ways. FOr example: Using default method argument, defining the same methods in multiple classes for different purpose.\n",
        "\n",
        "15.  What is an abstract class in Python ?\n",
        "- Abstract class is the class which contains the abstract methods. It's object can't be created.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP ?\n",
        "- Code reusability and use of classes for advance feature and code simplicity.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable ?\n",
        "- class variables are connected with the class and shared accross all the instances. Instance variables are defined using the self keyword and are seperate for each class object.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python ?\n",
        "- We can inherit multiple classes at a same time.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.  Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python ?\n",
        "- str is the normal string representation of class object in print statment, while __repr__ is the ambigius and developer friendly representation of class.\n",
        "\n",
        "20.  What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python ?\n",
        "- It is used in inheritance to call the parent classes properties like methods and variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python ?\n",
        "- It is used while delete operation. For example: del class_obj.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python ?\n",
        "- staticmethod decorator is used to define static methods and classmethod decorator is used to define the class methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance ?\n",
        "- we can override the parent class methods so that, we can change their functionality as per our need.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP ?\n",
        "- It is a programming style where we call multiple methods in a single line by calling one after another. Where each method in chain return their class object.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "- It is a dunder method in python used to make the class object callable like function or methods.\n",
